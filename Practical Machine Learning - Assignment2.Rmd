**Get Data, prepare for model building**
We are looking at a table with 151 potential predictor variables. 
```{r}
data <- getURL("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv",
               ssl.verifypeer=0L, followlocation=1L)
training <- read.csv(text=data, na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))

data <- getURL("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv",
               ssl.verifypeer=0L, followlocation=1L)
testing <- read.csv(text=data, na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
#Drop columns that don't add value for our predicion
training2 <- training[, -seq(from = 1, to = 8, by = 1)]
set.seed(244)

# Create additional Test Subset withing 40% of Total Training Data
# Training Subset with 60% of Total Training Data
inTest <- createDataPartition(y = training2$classe, p = 0.4, list = F)
test <- training2[inTest, ]
train <- training2[-inTest, ]
```

This dataset has a lot of variables that are sparse. To make our predictiors  more relevant it might be a good idea to get rid of variables that are sparse. Lets drop all that are NA for more than 15% of the observations.

```{r}
removeNAcols   <- function(x) { 
        x[ , colSums( is.na(x) ) < nrow(x) ] 
}
train <- removeNAcols(train)
test  <- removeNAcols(test)

removeanyNA       <- function(x) {
        x[,sapply(x, function(y) !any(is.na(y)))] 
}

train <- removeanyNA(train)
test  <- removeanyNA(test)

```

**Prediction Model** 
I will go ahead and use random forest to predict 'classe'. This prediction method is especially well suited for large number of variables or predictors.

```{r}

random.forest <- train(train,
                       train$classe,
                       tuneGrid=data.frame(mtry=3),
                       trControl=trainControl(method="none")
                       )
```

**Results**
Here are the results of the prediction model building
```{r, echo=FALSE }
summary(random.forest)
plot(varImp(random.forest))
```

**Cross Validation**

We can test our prediction against the 40% test data still untouched. THe accuracy and Kappa value of almost one show that our random forest  works well to predict accelerometer measurements.
```{r}
confusionMatrix(predict(random.forest,
                        newdata=test),
                test$classe
                )
```
